# Weekly Task: Verify URL Removal from Google Index

## Task Overview
Confirm that the removed URLs are no longer indexed by Google after one week.

## Verification Date
- **Target Check Date:** [Insert Date One Week from Today]

## Steps to Verify

### 1. Check Google Search Console
- Go to **Google Search Console** → **Removals**
- Ensure that all requested URLs are still listed under **Temporary Removals**
- Check the **Coverage Report** for any remaining indexed pages

### 2. Use Google Search Operator
Run the following search query in Google:
```
site:techeliteautomation.com/pages/
```
- If the removed URLs **no longer appear**, they have been successfully removed.
- If they **still appear**, Google may not have processed the request yet.

### 3. Verify Sitemap Update
- Ensure that the removed URLs are not listed in **sitemap.xml**
- Re-submit the sitemap in Google Search Console if necessary

### 4. Recheck HTTP Status Codes (Optional)
Run the following command for each removed URL to confirm they return **404 Not Found**:
```bash
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/about.html
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/projects.html
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/contact.html
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/faq.html
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/privacy.html
curl -I https://techeliteautomation.com/pages/services.html
```
- Expected output: `HTTP/2 404`

## Next Steps
- If URLs are still indexed: **Wait another week and recheck**
- If URLs are removed: **Task complete** ✅
- If unexpected results appear: **Investigate Google Search Console reports**

## Notes
- Google’s processing time varies; expect removals to take up to several weeks.
- If URLs persist for over a month, consider re-requesting removal or troubleshooting indexing settings.
